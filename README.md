# READ BOOK AND BOOKS TO READ

Welcome to my personal reading log! This repository is where I share the books I'm currently diving into. You'll find notes, 
summaries, and reflections on each titleâ€”ranging from technical reads to broader topics that inspire me. I believe that sharing 
what we learn not only deepens our own understanding but also sparks interesting discussions. Feel free to explore, leave feedback, 
or suggest new reads. Happy reading!
